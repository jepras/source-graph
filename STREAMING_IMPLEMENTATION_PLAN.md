# üöÄ Streaming Implementation Plan

*Branch: `feature/streaming-ai-output`*

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation of streaming AI output for the Canvas research functionality.

## üìã Implementation Overview

**Goal**: Replace the current loading spinner with real-time streaming of AI agent outputs during research.

**Current State**: 15-20 second wait with basic loading spinner
**Target State**: Immediate feedback with real-time AI thinking visible

## üö® Known Risks & Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Streaming complexity**: Mitigation - Start simple, add features incrementally
2. **Performance impact**: Mitigation - Test performance at each step
3. **Error handling**: Mitigation - Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
4. **Browser compatibility**: Mitigation - Use standard Server-Sent Events

### Fallback Plan
If streaming becomes too complex, we can implement **progressive display** instead:
- Show Agent 1's raw output immediately
- Show "structuring..." indicator
- Replace with final structured document

---

## üìù Notes

- Each step should be tested before moving to the next
- Keep existing functionality working throughout
- Document any issues or learnings
- Update this plan as we discover new requirements
