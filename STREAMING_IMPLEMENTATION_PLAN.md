# üöÄ Streaming Implementation Plan

*Branch: `feature/streaming-ai-output`*

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation of streaming AI output for the Canvas research functionality.

## üìã Implementation Overview

**Goal**: Replace the current loading spinner with real-time streaming of AI agent outputs during research.

**Current State**: 15-20 second wait with basic loading spinner
**Target State**: Immediate feedback with real-time AI thinking visible

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Backend Streaming Foundation

### Step 1.1: Add Streaming Endpoint (30 min) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create new endpoint `/api/canvas/research/stream` in `backend/app/api/routes/canvas.py`
- [x] Add basic streaming response using FastAPI's `StreamingResponse`
- [x] Return simple test stream (not AI yet)
- [x] Test: `curl -N http://localhost:8000/api/canvas/research/stream?item_name=test`

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/app/api/routes/canvas.py`

**Test criteria:**
- Endpoint returns immediate streaming response
- No errors in backend logs
- Can see test output in terminal

---

### Step 1.2: Add Streaming to Base Agent (45 min) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `stream_invoke` method to `BaseAgent` class
- [x] Use LangChain's streaming capabilities (`llm.astream()`)
- [x] Add streaming callback handler
- [x] Test: Verify agent can stream simple responses

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/app/services/ai_agents/base_agent.py`

**Test criteria:**
- Agent can stream responses chunk by chunk
- No errors in streaming implementation
- Streaming works with different model types

---

### Step 1.3: Modify Two-Agent for Streaming (1 hour) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add streaming version of `generate_research` method
- [x] Stream Agent 1's free-form analysis output
- [x] Stream Agent 2's structured extraction output
- [x] Add progress callbacks between agents
- [x] Test: Verify both agents stream their outputs

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/app/services/ai_agents/two_agent_canvas_agent.py`

**Test criteria:**
- Agent 1 streams cultural analysis
- Agent 2 streams structuring process
- Progress callbacks work correctly
- Final structured document is still generated

---

## üé® Phase 2: Frontend Streaming Display

### Step 2.1: Add Streaming State (30 min)
- [ ] Add `streamingOutput: string[]` to CanvasContext state
- [ ] Add `streamingActive: boolean` to track streaming status
- [ ] Add actions: `ADD_STREAMING_CHUNK`, `CLEAR_STREAMING`, `SET_STREAMING_ACTIVE`
- [ ] Test: Verify state updates correctly

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- `frontend/src/types/canvas.ts`

**Test criteria:**
- State updates when streaming chunks added
- Streaming status tracks correctly
- No state conflicts with existing functionality

---

### Step 2.2: Create Streaming Hook (45 min)
- [ ] Add `startResearchStreaming` method to `useCanvas.ts`
- [ ] Handle Server-Sent Events connection
- [ ] Parse streaming data and update state
- [ ] Handle connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, error)
- [ ] Test: Verify hook connects and receives data

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`

**Test criteria:**
- Hook connects to streaming endpoint
- Receives and parses streaming data
- Updates state with streaming chunks
- Handles connection errors gracefully

---

### Step 2.3: Add Streaming UI Component (1 hour)
- [ ] Create `StreamingDisplay` component
- [ ] Show real-time AI output with typing effect
- [ ] Add progress indicators during streaming
- [ ] Handle transition from streaming to final document
- [ ] Test: Verify UI updates with streaming data

**Files to create/modify:**
- `frontend/src/components/canvas/StreamingDisplay.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/canvas/CanvasTab.tsx`

**Test criteria:**
- Streaming output appears immediately
- Typing effect works smoothly
- Progress indicators update correctly
- Transitions to final document seamlessly

---

## üîó Phase 3: Integration & Polish

### Step 3.1: Connect Frontend to Backend (30 min)
- [ ] Wire up streaming hook to new backend endpoint
- [ ] Handle connection lifecycle properly
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Test: End-to-end streaming from UI to AI

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/canvas/CanvasTab.tsx`

**Test criteria:**
- Full end-to-end streaming works
- UI shows real AI output
- Error handling works correctly
- Performance is acceptable

---

### Step 3.2: Add Progress Indicators (45 min)
- [ ] Show progress bar during streaming
- [ ] Add stage transitions (Agent 1 ‚Üí Agent 2)
- [ ] Display estimated time remaining
- [ ] Add completion indicators
- [ ] Test: Verify progress updates correctly

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/src/components/canvas/StreamingDisplay.tsx`
- `frontend/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`

**Test criteria:**
- Progress bar updates smoothly
- Stage transitions are clear
- Time estimates are reasonable
- Completion is clearly indicated

---

### Step 3.3: Error Handling & Fallback (30 min)
- [ ] Handle streaming failures gracefully
- [ ] Fallback to regular loading if streaming fails
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms
- [ ] Test: Verify error scenarios work

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/canvas/CanvasTab.tsx`

**Test criteria:**
- Streaming failures don't break the app
- Fallback to regular loading works
- Retry mechanisms function correctly
- User experience remains smooth

## üö® Known Risks & Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Streaming complexity**: Mitigation - Start simple, add features incrementally
2. **Performance impact**: Mitigation - Test performance at each step
3. **Error handling**: Mitigation - Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
4. **Browser compatibility**: Mitigation - Use standard Server-Sent Events

### Fallback Plan
If streaming becomes too complex, we can implement **progressive display** instead:
- Show Agent 1's raw output immediately
- Show "structuring..." indicator
- Replace with final structured document

---

## üìù Notes

- Each step should be tested before moving to the next
- Keep existing functionality working throughout
- Document any issues or learnings
- Update this plan as we discover new requirements
